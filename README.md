# myMATLABtoolkit
It contains common functions that simplify the representation and signal processing analysis.

for example
Generally, in MATLAB output of fft or ifft function is an array, that does not have any mapping with the actual frequency values of the signal.
Through this code, proper frequency mapping represent the frequency content of the signal.

## fftplotting.m
Output of the this function is

Output of this function is properly define for any signal.

## ShowTimeDomainPlot.m
Output of the this function is

Time domain representation of the same signal.

Thank you
